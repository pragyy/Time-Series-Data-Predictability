# Time-Series-Data-Predictability

In this project we are analysing the air quality dataset of Delhi.

The dataset used is a time-series data. The dataset under consideration consists of four main pollutants viz, NO2, SO2, SPM and RSPM using which the Air Quality Index is calculated. It contains daily concentrations of the aforementioned pollutants from 2008-2010.

Various exponents and laws were used to determine the smoothness of the given dataset.

The Hurst exponent (H) is a statistical measure used to
classify time series. H=0.5 indicates a random series
while H>0.5 indicates a trend reinforcing series. The
larger the H value is, the stronger trend. 

With the help of Hurst exponent we can calculate the fractal dimension of dataset.

Additionally, we can compute the power law index which indicates the type of noise existing in the dataset.
