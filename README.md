# Time-Series-Data-Predictability

In this project the air quality dataset of Delhi is analyzed.

The dataset used is a time-series data. The dataset under consideration consists of four main pollutants viz; NO2, SO2, SPM and RSPM using which the Air Quality Index is calculated. It contains daily concentrations of the aforementioned pollutants from 2008-2010.

Various exponents and laws were used to determine the smoothness of the given dataset.

The Hurst exponent (H) is a statistical measure used to
classify time series. H=0.5 indicates a random series
while H>0.5 indicates a trend reinforcing series. The
larger the H value is, the stronger trend. 

With the help of Hurst exponent the fractal dimension of dataset is calculated which is used to characterise non-linear time-series.

Additionally, power law index is computed which indicates the type of noise existing in the dataset.
